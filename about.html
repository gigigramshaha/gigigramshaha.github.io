<h2>Who are you?</h2>
<h4>Georgeann Martin. Imagine that.</h4>
Since I was little, Iâ€™ve had a passion for technology. My dad worked an IT job, and many days were spent
toying with the different gadgets and computers he brought home. Other days were spent sitting by my
brother as we all took turns playing video games together. Our family always kept up with the latest
consoles and games; it was a group activity for us. So when I wanted to get into PC gaming in 8th grade,
of course my dad helped me build my first computer. Pair that with a phenomenal high school math teacher
who made algebra and calculus interesting, and my ideal career pursuit became crystal clear.

I'm a senior honors student at the University of Memphis, majoring in computer engineering, electrical
engineering, and math. From my studies, I've most enjoyed digital systems, coding, and web development,
though I have other interests as well (like boiled custard). Most of all, I love solving problems.
