            <p>
                Since I was little, Iâ€™ve had a passion for technology. My dad worked an IT job, and many days were spent
                toying with the different gadgets and computers he brought home. Other days were spent sitting by my
                brother as we all took turns playing video games together. Our family always kept up with the latest
                consoles and games; it was a group activity for us. So when I wanted to get into PC gaming in 8th grade,
                of course my dad helped me build my first computer. Pair that with a phenomenal high school math teacher
                who made algebra and calculus interesting, and my ideal career pursuit became crystal clear.
                <br><br>
                I'm a senior honors student at the University of Memphis, majoring in computer engineering, electrical
                engineering, and math. From my studies, I've most enjoyed digital systems, coding, and web development,
                though I have other interests as well (like boiled custard). Most of all, I love solving problems.

                I took one course on front-end development, and here we are.

                Back in the Fall of 2020, I took a software engineering course as a part of my degree program. Students
                were divided up into teams to create different components for a website, and the end result was so
                satisfying, I had to find some excuse to do it again.

                This website serves as a journal for my interests, whether it's a project I completed, a review for a
                book I read, or a blog on why Game of Thrones has been bad since season 5. Look around, enjoy your stay,
                and feel free to steal some ideas!
